## Kbc-in-Python
#### This is a command line game in which user have to guess correct answer of some questions and user have four options like in KBC game.
#### In this game, I used arrays and loops.
#### In this user have 4 lifelines named as 50-50, Pass the question, Audience poll, and Reuse. 
#### The features are like, if the user is not able to guess the right answer then he can use 50-50 life-line in which two wrong answers among the four options are eliminated.
#### If the user is not able to guess the right answer then he can also use pass the question lifline in which user gets a new question.
#### In Reuse lifeline user can use one already used lifeline.
